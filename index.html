        During the first semester of college, I knew I'd be eating out a lot. Mostly because I'm lazy and didn't know how to cook.
        Below are the foods I've bought from various fast food places and convenience store as a groggy <em>(and sometimes drunk)</em> freshman.
        These always hit the spot, but even more so if they're homemade. Which is why recipes are also provided.

                Karaage is Japanese fried chicken. It is one of my favorite foods. I usually buy these in the frozen section of the supermarket. In my opinion,
                the supermarket ones tastes better than fast food ones. <em>Cheaper tastes good</em>. I like to pair this with chili oil and a creamy sauce like 
                mayonnaise. I've eaten this practically every year for my birthday. <br> <br>
                <strong><em>I hope that after this you love karaage as much as I do lol.</em></strong>

                    Salmon onigiri is basically rice stuffed with salmon wrapped in seaweed. Most people drink alcohol with chips and other snacks.
                    I drink while eating salmon onigiri. When I think I deserve a treat I stop by a nearby 7-eleven and buy these. If I'm especially broke I'll buy the 
                    tuna one. Nothing hits like savory salmon in cold rice wrapped in seaweed that won't rip apart at 3am. <br> <br>

                    Umami, cheap and, questionable are the three words I'd use to describe this dish. They say if you it a lot of this you might die early lol. 
                    <em>Mostly because of the beef parts and sodium content</em>
                    There's lots of vendors on the street selling this stew. They're usually open at ungodly hours of the night and surrounded by workers who want a quick
                     meal. As a sleep-deprived college student who doesn't even have time to eat, this was an easy way to put a warm meal into my body. Although I wouldn't recommend
                     eating this more than once a week. <br> <br>

                     <strong><em>This recipe is probably the best way to enjoy it and still live.</em></strong>

                    No matter what anyone says, we all know that the superior siopao flavor is bola-bola. This was another thing I'd go for at 7-eleven. It was always hot 
                    <em>sometimes even burning</em>, and really filling. I had a PE class early in the morning and I'd always stop by to grab one of these to eat on the 
                    commute to university. <br> <br>
