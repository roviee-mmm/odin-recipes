        <li>2 teaspoons dry stake</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>4 skin-on chicken thighs (about

            2-inch chunks</li>
        <li>Peanut oil, or a mixture of peanut
            and canola or safflower, for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup potato starch (katakuriko)</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon fine sea salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon black pepper</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Step 1: Marinating the chicken</dt>
        <dd>
            In a shallow baking dish large enough to hold the chicken, combine ginger, garlic, sake, soy sauce and sugar. <br> 
            Toss chicken pieces in marinade to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours.<br>
        </dd>

        <dt>Step 2: Preparing the frying station</dt>
        <dd>
            Fill an aluminum or thin stainless steel pot (best for quick temperature adjustments), with sides at least 5 inches tall, with about 3 inches of peanut oil. <br>
            Heat the oil to 350 degrees. Place several layers of newsprint or paper towels on a sheet pan. <br>
        </dd>

        <dt>Step 3: Battering the chicken</dt>
        <dd>
            While the oil heats, place a wire rack over a second sheet pan. In a bowl, combine potato starch, salt and pepper. <br>
            Remove one piece of chicken at a time from marinade, and tuck in any jagged bits or skin as you roll it in starch mixture to coat. <br>
            Rest it on the rack. Repeat with all chicken pieces. <br>
        </dd>

        <dt>Step 4: Frying the chicken for the first time</dt>
        <dd>
            Gently shake off excess potato starch before cooking each piece of chicken. <br>
            Fry 3 or 4 pieces at a time, keeping oil temperature around 325 degrees (temperature will fall when you add chicken) and no lower than 300 degrees. <br>
            Fry for about 3 minutes, or until golden. <br>
            Remove from oil using a wire-mesh spoon or long chopsticks, and cool on newsprint or paper towels.<br>
        </dd>

        <dt>Step 5: Frying the chikcen a second time</dt>
        <dd>
            When all the chicken has been fried once, increase the oil’s temperature to 375 degrees. <br>
            Fry chicken pieces a second time, keeping the oil between 350 and 375 degrees, until the crust is deep golden brown, about 1 minute. <br>
            Drain on newsprint or paper towels. This second frying makes the coating stay extra crisp, even if you don’t serve it immediately. <br>
        </dd>

        <dt>Step 6: Serve the dish</dt>
        <dd>Serve hot or at room temperature, with a lemon wedge, and lettuce and cucumber slices for a cool, fresh contrast, if you like. <br>

        </dd>
    </dl>
