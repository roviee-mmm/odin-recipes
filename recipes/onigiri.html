    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Step 1: Preparing the salmon</dt>
        <dd>
            The day before you want to make your onigiri, cure the salmon by setting it on a baking sheet lined with paper towels. <br>
            The paper towels will help drain off any liquid the salmon releases. Sprinkle about a teaspoon of salt evenly over the 
            surface of the fish. <br>
            The salted salmon can be kept in the fridge for up to 3 days. <br>
        </dd>

        <dt>Step 2: Cooking the salmon</dt>
        <dd>
            When you're ready to cook the salmon, place it skin-side down in a non-stick frying pan. <br>
            Add two tablespoons of sake, cover the pan with a lid, and turn the heat on to medium-high. <br>
            Once the sake reaches a rolling boil, lower the heat to sustain a gentle simmer. <br>
            Set a timer for three minutes. Steaming the salmon ensures a uniformly tender and fluffy 
            texture while the sake infuses the fish with umami.<br>
        </dd>

        <dt>Step 3: De-boning the salmon</dt>
        <dd>
            When the timer is up, transfer the salmon to a clean surface. <br>
            When it's cool enough to handle, peel off the skin and remove any pin bones. <br>
            Now, use your fingers to gently flake the salmon apart. <br>
            If you want finer flakes, you can rub the flakes between your fingertips to crumble them up even more. <br>
        </dd>

        <dt>Step 4: Assembling the onigiri</dt>
        <dd>
            To make the salmon onigiri, cut a sheet of plastic wrap in front of you and sprinkle on a pinch of salt. <br> 
            This will lightly salt the exterior of the onigiri. <br> 
            Heap a mound of cooked rice into the center of the wrap and make a small well in the center. <br> 
            Add a generous helping of your salmon flakes into the hole, and cover it with another layer of rice. <br> 
        </dd>

        <dt>Step 5: Forming the onigiri</dt>
        <dd>
            To form the onigiri, lift the bottom edge of the plastic wrap and fold it over the rice. <br> 
            Bring the top corners down over the rice to make a triangular bundle. Shape one hand like a "U" and place the bundle of rice in it. <br> 
            Shape the other hand like a "V" and press your hands together to lightly compress the rice. <br> 
            The hallmark of a great onigiri is in the delicate balance of pressure that's enough to hold its shape but not so much that it 
            becomes dense and heavy. <br> 
            Another option is to use a plastic onigiri mold which will make these easier to shape.<br> 
        </dd>

        <dt>Step 6: Adding nori</dt>
        <dd>
            As for the nori strips, I'd recommend wrapping your salmon rice balls when you plan to eat it. <br> 
            This ensures the seaweed remains crisp, creating a delightful textural contrast with the soft rice and moist salmon. <br> 
            Just drape the nori strip, shiny side out, around the back of the onigiri like you're putting a blanket over its shoulders and fold the edges over, pressing them gently into the rice.<br> 
        </dd>
    </dl>
